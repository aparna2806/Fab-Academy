<h3> Embedded Programming </h3>
Assignment: Use your programmer (HUZZAH32, ESP32 Feather) to program a circuit with a “led and a bottom” to do something
Assignment: I coded an LED light to turn on and off depending on the basis of potentiometer.

The arduino code below:
for setting up:
-LED_PIN 11
-POTENTIOMETER_PIN A1
we need to initialize the mode for the pins we want to use:
void setup()
{
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}
we can start to control the brightness of the LED with what we read from the potentiometer:
void loop()
{
  int potentiometerValue = analogRead(A1);
}
using Arduino map() function which can put a number into a different range.
  int brightness = map(potentiometerValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
}

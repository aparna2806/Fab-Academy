#week-10 & week13
<h5> April 5 </h5>
<h3> Input and Output Devices </h3>
<h3> Task </h3>
Allowing communication between two components on a pcb or breadbord or rasberry pi. We have to make a circuit where there is back and forth information transfer about the state of the button (digital) the potentiometer(analog)

<h3>Learnings:
<li>The section is aimed at INPUTS (sensors) and for OUTPUTS (motors, LEDs)
<li>We touched upon the basics of electronics such as amperage, voltage and current.
<li>We saw different kinds of motors we can find (DC, steppers and MOSFETs, servomotors...), then LEDs, piezo and some others.
<h3>Process</h3>
<li>Borka and I teamed up again as we decided to learn electronics together. Jeremy was super helpful when we had silliest of the doubts
<li>We wanted to make something simple as we lost touch with arduino and the basics of it (last we did was during tech beyond myth class).
<li>We pulled out potentiometer and led from the kit we received. Later on, some resistors, jumper wires and huzzah32 adafruit.
<li>Making connections was fairly easy. But we were thinking of how to make them talk if they are on two different pcb or breadboard.
<li>Bluetooth could be one option. But we ran into multiple troubles trying to achieve that. So we took a step back.
<li>After some time, we got to know that there is TX RX connection system also that could be explored if we want to pass on information from one board to another.
<li>Finally, we wrote code for declaring the components to the pin they are connected to and then initialising it.

<h5> Challenge 4 </h5>
<p> This last challenge I decided to work on my final project- Epoch of the Greedy Parasite. The aim is to learn to code my ideas for the fest that's coming up in few days. I got immense support and guidance from Jeremy for this challenge.</p>

## What you will find in this repo
1. Documentation for micro challenge 04
2. Images of the outcome
3. Thesis Prototypes

## Project description
<p>Theme:A series of digital narratives that provoke the user to look at the world through the lens of parasitic relationships and further investigate the characteristics that define our role and behaviours as a parasite. I worked on miro gathering inspiration and read some more reading material.</p>

## In Process
(Images/sprite.gif)
- The concept of sprites and getting each image in a sequence and moving the x position of the image.
- An empty array created for images
- Using the push method to add images into the array
- Making the sketch move in the x direction

(Images/sprite2.gif)
- Using setTimeout() and setInterval() to create a delay for animation.

- Example of the syntax:
//declaring setTimeout
<p>setTimeout(textDis,18000);</p>
<p>setTimeout(newShape,22000);</p>
//declaring function
<p>function textDis(){</p>
<p>showText=true;</p>
<p>setTimeout(textHide,3000);</p>
<p>};</p>

<p>if (showText){</p>
<p> textFont(font1);</p>
<p> textSize(200);</p>
<p> fill('yellow');</p>
<p> text('epoch of the anthropocene',15,280);</p>
}</p>
